PREREQUISITES:
- Make sure that the ZED camera is plugged into the client computer.

STEPS:
1. Open two terminal windows.
2. In one of the windows, type this command in: "python3 server.py"
    - This will run the server of the socket communication model. This will display the camera feed
    to the specified host IP on the specified port.
3. In another window, type this command in: "python3 run_video_over_socket.py -model_name <model>"
    - <model> will be the name of a specified model inside of the "models_folder" folder inside of the
    "socket_communciation" folder
    - If <model> is "None", then the default "yolov5m.pt" model is used
4. If there are no errors with binding the socket and establishing the communication with the server
a Video Feed window will appear.
5. Bounding boxes should appear around the object(s) that the model is trained on. yolov5m model is 
trained on the COCO dataset.

FUTURE PLANS:
- We need to run the server script on the computer that will be hosting the C++ GUI.
    - Ideally, we want to have the video feed be displayed IN the GUI window and not in a separate window
