Hydrophone Theory

Hydrophones in the context of this club act as underwater microphones. This is a transducer blah blah blah
All scenarios and maths assume standard units (seconds, meters, meters per second, degrees).
All scenarios assume a single point sound source at a fixed frequency.
Code is all pseudocode, don't copy paste and expect it to work.

The following array size of N hydrophones can determine the following given a single point sound source:

N   Detection
_____________________________________
0   Not a whole lot...
1   Relativistic Distance Changes Over Time
2   ^ & Angle relative to sound source
3   ^^ & Triangulate distance to sound source
4   ^^^ & 3 axis localization + COS error correction for yaw

This assumes in plane up to 3 (equilateral triangle orientation), the 4th forming a tetrahedral array.


This can be seen in the following cases:

1 TRANSDUCER:
    We can only determine the distance to a transducer in a relativistic sense given strong knowledge of both
    the period of transmission from the transducer.

    In the Robosub case we know the model of sound source (pinger) used, and can determine the selected rate of
    successive pings is 2.048 seconds. If our detection algorithm is able to trigger on the same point of a ping
    we can set a start point, at the next ping we can compare t1 to t0 to 2.048 seconds (T_ping).
    Given a longer period between pings we know we have moved some distance further, and given a shorter period
    we know me have moved some distance closer.

    This distance is possible to measure, but only if the speed of sound in the medium is understood well. In that
    case we can perform:

        DISTANCE_CHANGE = (t1 - t0) * SPEED_OF_SOUND 


2 TRANSDUCERS:
    Adding a second sensor allows phase or ToA differences to be determined, giving angle of incidence data on the
    wavefront vs. the transducer array's long axis. Phase calculations are in depth and covered in their own paper.
    Time difference to angle is found simply as:

        td_0 = 0
        td_1 = !0

        Wavefront_Angle = acos( (td_1 - td_0) / (ARRAY_LONG_AXIS_DISTANCE_ON_CENTER / SPEED_OF_SOUND) )

        AngleOfIncidence = Wavefront_Angle - 90

    We can still perform the same relativistic measurements as we did with one transducer.

3 TRANSDUCERS:
    We can additionally perform ToA or phase difference between a reference waveform, such that:
        Transducer A is first detection, Transducer B is 2nd, transducer C is 3rd.
    
    Then we need to remember the theory and not be in class. I'll finish this later.
